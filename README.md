# This is my first ever JavaScript Project 

## Disclaimer
This project was made before ever learning how to code with JavaScript. For this one I used the help of AI. I am planing on rebuilding this on the future with the knowledge that I have gathered along.
You can see the project [here](https://aru-kiwu.github.io/cookie-clicker-game/).

## A little bit about this project
This project came to me quite funny when I stared replaying the original [Cookie Clicker](https://cookieclicker.com) game with a friend. 
So I wanted to recreate this, but I knew almost no Java Script. And this is how far I got just with some basic knoledge and some great Google searches.
The purpose of the game is to get one Cookie Galaxy Upgrade.

## Resources that I used
- [Bing Image Creator](url) -- I used this to generate the cookie png.
- [ChatGPT](url) -- I used this to generate the autoIncrement function.
- [Mixkit](https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/click/) -- I used this for the sound effects, and [this one](https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/search/click/) aswell.
